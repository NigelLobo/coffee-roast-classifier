# coffee-roast-classifier
### Background

Popular coffee YouTuber, James Hoffman, conducted a tasting survey of 5000 Americans by mailing them coffee samples and having them answer a questionnaire. He uploaded a YouTube video aggregating the results but did not apply machine learning to the dataset.

### Goal
The goal of this project is to predict a person's desired coffee roast level (light/medium/dark) based on demographics, habits and ratings of 4 benchmark coffees. I will build a classifier to predict the target variable roast_level
